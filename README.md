# MeasureTwiceExe
MeasureTwice executables 

I'm refactoring measuretwice, it is a hot mess. 


i took out cinder, and just switched it to gl/imgui.. SO i'll drop the older binary on here for cinder and occasionally add the newer one .. but its my scratchpad application for doing a lot of things, some of them i haven't finished either, it's a little crashy too as i know where not to click! 

but hopefully it motivates me to make it more stable and useful to others, as it is now i mostly use it for image processing tests from rtsp/capture streams.

the measure aspect isn't really working at the moment, but it can find circles etc once the input image is correct.

the resolution stuff in the camera streamer i'm using isn't great so it has to manually search for the resolutions and it'll choose the largest available and doesn't let you switch yet.
